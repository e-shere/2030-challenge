		<p>In summary, we propose mass production of previously stated carbon microspheres. They are an efficient and enviromentally friendly solution to dealing with our overwhelming and ever-growing amount of plastic waste, and unlike other ways of dealing with plastic it produces no toxins and no greenhouse gases. Converting plastic to carbon microspheres would deal with the problems that arise from contamination of the enviroment by the plastics, it would mean we would no longer polute ground water and would reduce the number of fatalities of sea-creatures caused by them mistaking plastic bags for food. As well as being a good way of getting rid of our mounds of waste, these carbon microspheres have a large range of uses.<br><br>The one we have mostly focused on in our research is the use of carbon microspheres in the production of anodes for lithium batteries. Doing this, greatly increases the life of the batteries while reducing the use and waste of fossil fuels (and lithium) in the manufacturing process of both batteries and plastics. Currently a lot of oil is used as the raw material and to release energy in the production of plastics and then it all ends up in landfills, due to the amount of fuel put into their production plastics actually have a higher energy value that coal so it would be a huge waste to not put non-recyclable plastics to use.<br><br>It may be questioned on what scale will this change in batteries be useful and whether it will make much of a difference. Well to answer that question the global battery market is predicted to be worth about $120 billion US dollars by 2019 with the cost of batteries reaching up to $300-500 per kwh. These lithium batteries get used in all sorts of devices such as pacemakers and they have just sucessfully passed their test for use in space sattelites, meaning that the batteries these will have to use will now become less bulky and last for longer.<br><br>An example of a further equally important use of carbon microspheres is in the production of networks with hm-chitosan which makes a completely biocompatible polymer. It can be made into a gel that has significant applications in drug delivery and hemostasis (the stopping of a flow of blood).<br><br>We have found and believe that carbon microspheres would be a magnificent way to solve many of our problems, from groundwater pollution to lithium supply and assist scientists in the development of drugs.<br><br></p>
