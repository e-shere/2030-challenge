		 		<h1>Natural resource protection</h1>
			</div>
			<p><img class = "img-responsive pull-right" style = "margin-left:20px" src="http://www.fidesarrollo.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Gesti%C3%B3n-para-la-protecci%C3%B3n-y-Conservaci%C3%B3n-de-los-recursos-naturales.jpg">According to research if we continue to exploit natural resouces at the current rate they will be exhausted by 2050. The major resources that we are using are fossil fuels (oil, coal and natural gas), they are formed from the remains of ancient plant and animal life. Fossil fuel burning powers our vehicles and industries, heats and cools our buildings, and runs appliances. It also produces electricity that we use for all sorts of purposes, such as lights and computers. Even though we have started oil mining just over 50 years ago, sixteen of the world's twenty largest oil fields have already reached their peak level of production (the point at which they are producing their maximum annual oil yield).<br><br>To reduce our explotation of natural resources we are turning towards using renewable ones (they quickly replenish themselves and can be used again and again, for this reason they are sometimes wrongly called "infinite energy resources"), examples of such are solar, wind and hydroelectric power. Currently the UK is producing enough energy through wind turbines to fully power more than 9.5 million homes and reducing CO<sub>2</sub> emmisions by over 16 million tonnes per year. However fossil fuels are not the only resources that we are using too much of, there are many metals that fall into that category too ranging from silver and gold for jewelry to yttrium for colour displays on devices such as television screens.</p>

				 		<h1>Energy conservation and efficiency</h1>
					</div>
					<p>Energy efficiency is "using less energy to provide the same service", or to be more precise making systems work so that less energy get transformed into unwanted forms. We would like our energy conversion systems to be perfect with <i>all</i> of the input energy being converted only to the form we want - for example all the input energy for a light bulb beight converted into light rather that some of it being converted to heat. However real systems do not archieve this level of complete, or 100%, efficiency mainly due to friction between surfaces which converts some of the energy to heat and sound.<br><br>To demonstrate how far we still need to go to archieve complete efficiency lets take a look at a typical car, out of all the energy released by burning petrol only 38% gets transferred to kinetic energy, a further 2% is used for the lights, radio and battery but the rest is "wasted" as heat and sound. Of course engineers have made new developments improving efficiency of every day devices for example modern energy efficient light bulbs use up to 80% less energy and can last for up to 25 time longer than previously. <br><br>One of the main ways of reducing landfill, in incinerators, is a good example of a relatively efficient system. The incinerators burn the waste and 80% of the energy released is put to use, however the problem with incinerators is that they release CO<sub>2</sub> and other harmful chemicals into the atmosphere.<br><br></p>

		 		<h1>Plastic waste management</h1>
			</div>
			<p><img class = "img-responsive pull-left" style = "margin-right:20px" src="http://procameroun.com/Mbeng/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/pollution-plastique-424x282.jpg">Plastic waste is a big enviromental problem, as it can take as many as 1000 years to decompose and our plastic comsumption keeps on growing reaching about 300 million tons in 2015. Altough biodegrable plastics have been developed they only make up 7% of the plastics produced; the rest end up in land fills where they leak pollutants into the soil and water and a large part of it is floating around in the oceans threatening the lives of marine creatures. <br><br>Over 8 million tonnes of plastic waste end up in the ocean every year and in some places the ration of plastic to plankton is 26:1. Over 600 species of marine life are known to suffer directly from plastic pollution including some on the IUCN red list list such as the Hawaiian monk seal, loggerhead turtle and sooty shearwater. Birds consume plastic, and an increasing number starve when their stomachs are full of plastic waste. Over 90% of seabirds worldwide have plastic pieces in their stomachs. <br><br>Relatively little plastic is recycled because there are so many different types of it produced, which all have different chemical compositions, some of the added substances can be harmful to health if broken down. Plastic waste is also contaminated by materials such as paper and ink. Separating plastics from non-plastics in the recycling process, and different types of plastic from each other is labor-intensive and so far, there has been no easy solution. The production of plastics uses fossil fuels, it is estimated that 8% of globally extracted oil goes into this both as the raw material and to release energy for the production process, this results in plastics having an energy value higher than coal. So the plastic landfills are not only an enviromental hazard but also a huge waste of resources.<br><br></p>
