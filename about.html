			</div>
			<p>The lithium-ion batteries that we use nowdays are a major part of our lives, they get used in almost any device from phones to cars. They are much lighter and can store several times more energy compared to other types of batteries but even so they have their limits. Over time as the battery is recharged and discharged, the anode and cathode get worn out and degrade reducing the battery's storage capacity and putting a limit on its useful lifespan. Another problem with the lithium-ion batteries is that they depend on the dwindling supplies of the metal lithium, currently we have enough of the metal to last us another 365 years, however if our demands for it keep on growing at the same rate we will only have a 17-year supply.<br><br>So extending the lifespan of these batteries would not only make them more useful but also help to reduce the rate at wich we use up our supplies of lithium. This where the research done by a team from the <a href="https://www.anl.gov/">Argonne National Laboratory</a> in USA comes in. They have developed a way of creating carbon microspheres about 2 to 5 micrometres in size, which although low in cost due to a low-energy production process have a range of high value uses. In lithium-ion batteries they can be used to make carbon anodes that maintain their shape and don't degrade, but they can also be applied in inks, high-performance composites and as a lubricant in engines to reduce wear and tear. <br><br>But what's even better is that the carbon microsphere manufacturing process completely destroys unwanted plastic waste in an enviromentally friendly manner (unlike incinerators). Unsorted plastic is first heated to 2800 degrees Celcius at a high pressure and then cooled to 350 degrees. This process gives the new material a layered structure and allows the microspheres to form, due to these transformations the material is almost as hard as  diamond but has electrochemical properties of graphite.</p>
